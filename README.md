Homework #4 – Parse Roman Numerals in Assembly

CS 3844 Section 0B1,

Given the shell of a C program, namor.c, write assembly code to convert strings in “additive notation” Roman Numerals to numbers, as shown in en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals. For example, “XXXXIIII” in our notation is 44. We don’t allow “XLIV” as in normal “subtractive notation”. This is quite a bit easier to work with.

You cannot do any of the logic in C, other than what is already given to you.

No error checking is needed. Assume all input is valid and in UPPER CASE only.

Some hints and examples are provided in the namor.c file.

This is the reverse of HW #3.
